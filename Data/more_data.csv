finances are protected and you can carry on your business smoothly without suffering from cash flow constraints With our Professional Indemnity Insurance Policy you can get up to Rs 1 crore as coverage along with several benefitsIn a nutshell any professional who guides advises or provides services to clients or companies should opt for professional indemnity insurance This usually includes

invest in a professional indemnity insurance policy Additionally the list of professionals who would benefit from the coverage offered by a professional indemnity insurance policy includes engineers architects counsellors financial consultants chartered accountants contractors and interior decoratorsThe cost of a professional indemnity insurance policy depends on a range of factors To arrive at a figure the insurer could take into account factors such as the sum insured the revenue of the medical practitioner or establishment the professional record of the prospective policyholder as well as the specialty of the medical professional For instance it is believed that as compared to a general physician specialists such as cardiologists or gynecologists are more likely to encounter greater risks at a higher frequency This impacts the premium charged Apart from these factors the size of the establishment equipment skill levels of the support staff such as nurses limits of indemnity selected as well as the ratio of limits are taken into consideration when determining the premium Lastly if you’re renewing your policy remember that the number of claims you have made in the past

factors come into the equation—how much you borrowed the rate of interest and the loan tenure There are ways to bring your EMI down for one it drops automatically if there is a decrease in interest rates or if you pay back more than you need to (called a ‘partial prepayment’) You can easily increase the amount you pay in EMIs in the following ways• Login into our customer portal Experia• You can visit us at https//wwwbajajfinservin/reach-us• You can call us on 020 3957 4151 (call charges apply)An amortization schedule is a table giving the reduction of your loan amount by monthly instalments The amortization schedule gives the break-up of every EMI towards repayment of interest and the outstanding principal of your loan When interest rates go up the interest component of an EMI also goes up The EMI is kept constant but will result in a lower principal component If the rates move up continuously then there might be a situation where the interest Component becomes more than the EMI In such a situation principal component (EMI minus interest component) gives a negative figure Consequently the outstanding balance instead of being reduced from the opening principal with the principal component gets increased with the negative principal component This is commonly referred to as negative amortization A loan where the amortization is negative does not get repaid since the regular payments are insufficient to cover the interest component The unpaid interest gets added to the principal and makes it grow The situation gets reversed only when interest rates start falling In this situation the customer has to part-prepay the loan amount increase the EMI of the loan or do bothIn case of a loan with a floating interest the interest component is subject to change When the rates change one of the following two changes can be done to a loan •The term of the Loan is extended (when rates go up) or contracted (when rates go down)•The EMI amount is reset (increased in case rates go up & reduced in case rates come down)As a practice the term of the loan is extended since the customer might have given post-date cheques and it would be difficult to replace them on every rate change However in case of under construction properties the Pre-EMI amount is increased by defaultYou can choose any of the above options according to your convenience The default option is to change the EMI to match the balance tenure of a loanThe pricing increase happens only in the scenario of an increase in the Cost of Funds Pro-active repricing policy is being put in place as a proactive measure to ensure that there is no inordinate increase in your loan pricing against new acquisitions and there is always parity for your loan As a goodwill gesture and to maintain transparency with

practitioner in the event that you face allegations of malpractice negligence misdiagnosis incorrect treatment etc a professional indemnity insurance policy will provide the cover to protect your finances The purpose of professional indemnity insurance is to safeguard doctors from professional risks such as legal defense costs claims for compensation injury damage borne by a third party or breach of confidentiality amongst others In a time where patients’ expectations of compensation are significant and the costs associated with litigation are high professional indemnity insurance is the need of the hour to protect your finances as a doctor By investing in this policy you can ensure that despite the 110% increase in the number of legal cases pertaining to medical negligence your finances are protected and you can carry on your business smoothly without suffering from cash flow constraints With our Professional Indemnity Insurance Policy you can get up to Rs 1 crore as coverage along with several benefitsIn a nutshell any professional who guides advises or provides services to clients or companies should opt for professional indemnity insurance This usually includes doctors such as surgeons consultants physicians pathologists and specialists When it comes to medical professionals establishments such as clinics nursing homes and polyclinics are also advised to invest in a professional indemnity insurance policy Additionally the list of professionals who would benefit from the coverage offered by a professional indemnity insurance policy includes engineers architects counsellors financial consultants chartered accountants contractors and interior decoratorsThe cost of a professional indemnity insurance policy depends on a range of factors To arrive at a figure the insurer could take into account factors such as the sum insured the revenue of the medical practitioner or establishment the professional record of the prospective policyholder as well as the specialty of the medical professional For instance it is believed that as compared to a general physician specialists such as cardiologists or gynecologists are more likely to encounter greater risks at a higher frequency This impacts the premium charged Apart from these factors the size of the establishment equipment skill levels of the support staff such as nurses limits of indemnity selected as well as the ratio of limits are taken into consideration when determining the premium Lastly if you’re renewing your policy remember that the number of claims you have made in the past will have a bearing on the premium The number of claims and the claim amounts help insurers determine what is to be expected and they adjust the premium accordingly However to get a rough estimate you can assume 02% to 1% of the sum insured to be the premium amount that you will have to pay With Bajaj Finserv you can get professional indemnity insurance of up to Rs 1 crore with affordable premiums starting as low as Rs 9440Whether or not professional indemnity insurance is a legal requirement for you depends on the nature of your profession For doctors for instance it isn’t mandatory but is highly recommended The same applies to other service providers such as architects and engineers Given the fact that it provides you with a safety net in the event that you’re caught in a legal liability its benefits far outweigh the associated costPublic liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance may seem similar at first glance but the difference between the two lies in the nuances A public liability insurance policy is a must for a company whose operations can cause property or physical damage to persons A public liability policy also covers the scenario where a third party suffers from physical or property damage owing to being present at the business’ premises On the other hand professional indemnity insurance covers liabilities in a more tailored fashion It covers liabilities strictly arising out of a professional’s services advice or guidance provided to a client or recipient For instance if a patient is suspicious of medical negligence on the part of a doctor he or she may file a legal complaint To address the costs associated with such a complaint the doctor can make use of a professional indemnity insurance policy Disclaimer *Conditions apply This

event that you face allegations of malpractice negligence misdiagnosis incorrect treatment etc a professional indemnity insurance policy will provide the cover to protect your finances The purpose of professional indemnity insurance is to safeguard doctors from professional risks such as legal defense costs claims for compensation injury damage borne by a third party or breach of confidentiality amongst others In a time where patients’ expectations of compensation are significant and the costs associated with litigation are high professional indemnity insurance is the need of the hour to protect your finances as a doctor By investing in this policy you can ensure that despite the 110% increase in the number of legal cases pertaining to medical negligence your finances are protected and you can carry on your business smoothly without suffering from cash flow constraints With our Professional Indemnity Insurance Policy you can get up to Rs 1 crore as coverage along with several benefitsIn a nutshell any professional who guides advises or provides services to clients or companies should opt for professional indemnity insurance This usually includes doctors such as surgeons consultants physicians pathologists and specialists When it comes to medical professionals establishments such as clinics nursing homes and polyclinics are also advised to invest in a professional indemnity insurance policy Additionally the list of professionals who would benefit from the coverage offered by a professional indemnity insurance policy includes engineers architects counsellors financial consultants chartered accountants contractors and interior decoratorsThe cost of a professional indemnity insurance policy depends on a range of factors To arrive at a figure the insurer could take into account factors such as the sum insured the revenue of the medical practitioner or establishment the professional record of the prospective policyholder as well as the specialty of the medical professional For instance it is believed that as compared to a general physician specialists such as cardiologists or gynecologists are more likely to encounter greater risks at a higher frequency This impacts the premium charged Apart from these factors the size of the establishment equipment skill levels of the support staff such as nurses limits of indemnity selected as well as the ratio of limits are taken into consideration when determining the premium Lastly if you’re renewing your policy remember that the number of claims you have made in the past will have a bearing on the premium The number of claims and the claim amounts help insurers determine what is to be expected and they adjust the premium accordingly However to get a rough estimate you can assume 02% to 1% of the sum insured to be the premium amount that you will have to pay With Bajaj Finserv you can get professional indemnity insurance of up to Rs 1 crore with affordable premiums starting as low as Rs 9440Whether or not professional indemnity insurance is a legal requirement for you depends on the nature of your profession For doctors for instance it isn’t mandatory but is highly recommended The same applies to other service providers such as architects and engineers Given the fact that it provides you with a safety net in the event that you’re caught in a legal liability its benefits far outweigh the associated costPublic liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance may seem similar at first glance but the difference between the two lies in the nuances A public liability insurance policy is a must for a company whose operations can cause property or physical damage to persons A public liability policy also covers the scenario where a third party suffers from physical or property damage owing to being present at the business’ premises On the other hand professional indemnity insurance covers liabilities in a more tailored fashion It covers liabilities strictly arising out of a professional’s services advice or guidance provided to a client or recipient For instance if a patient is suspicious of medical negligence on the part of a doctor he or she may file a legal complaint To address the costs associated with such a complaint the doctor can make use of a professional indemnity insurance policy Disclaimer *Conditions apply This product is offered under

March This calculation can be used for claiming the Income tax rebates in appropriate cases under Section 80C as well as Section 24 of the Income Tax Act The calculations are based upon Current Principal Balances Current ROI and Current EMI along with any changes recorded in the Current Financial Year Any change that may happen before the end of the Financial Year will alter the calculation and the figures You can get this in the following ways• By logging into our Customer Portal “Experia” • Visit us at https//wwwbajajfinservin/reach-usThe Provisional Income Tax Certificate can change under certain circumstances like change in Interest Rate The projection is calculated on “as is” basis and does not consider any future change that may happen either on the Interest EMI or the PrincipalYour EMI consists of two parts—paying back the principal amount you borrowed plus the interest rates charged ‘on’ it Three factors come into the equation—how much you borrowed the rate of interest and the loan tenure There are ways to bring your EMI down for one it drops automatically if there is a drop in interest rates or if you pay back more than you need to (called a ‘partial prepayment’)There are two ways of going about this • An Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) is an easy and convenient option available exclusively to those that have a bank account Your EMIs get paid out automatically from your account every month at a specified date • With Bajaj Finance you may also choose to hand in a fresh set of Post-Dated Cheques (PDCs) ahead of time from any bank account Note that this is only for those customers in non-ECS locations • ECS is the preferred mode as it’s faster and there are no chances of errors Plus there’s no hassle of replacing PDCs when the EMi changes or when they run outWhen there’s an unexpected increase in interest rates Bajaj Finance first attempts to make things easier on you by increasing the loan tenure—within permissible limits If this doesn’t resolve the issue—covering interests under current EMI—we’ll need to increase the EMI Another solution—you can make a partial prepayment at the nearest Bajaj Finance Branch to reduce the interest amount Alternatively you can choose to part-prepay online via the Experia portalYou can choose to pay your EMIs by electronic methods (ECS) by handing in post-dated cheques or through direct payments • Going in for the ECS option you’ll need to pay the revised amount from the subsequent month; you’ll be paying the differential amount separately during the current month • If you’re going with the PDCs you’ll need to completely replace your old cheques No matter what your method of payment is it goes without saying that the EMI needs to be paid before the due date You can choose to increase the EMI amount whenever you choose to during the loan tenure Taking advantage of this you can reduce the loan tenure and save a whole lot of money on the loan To avail this option • Log on to the “Experia” portal or • Visit us at https//wwwbajajfinservin/reach-usWhen interest rates go up the interest component of an EMI also goes up The EMI is kept constant as explained in the previous section which results in a lower principal component If the rates move up continuously then there might be a situation where the interest Component becomes more than the EMI In such a situation principal component (EMI minus interest component) gives a negative figure Consequently the outstanding balance instead of being reduced from the opening principal with the principal component gets increased with the negative principal component This is commonly referred to as negative amortization A loan where the amortization is negative does not get repaid ever since the regular payments are insufficient to cover the interest component The unpaid interest gets added to the principal and makes it grow The situation gets reversed only when interest rates start falling The customer does part-prepayment or increases the EMIIn case of a home loan with variable rate the interest rate used to calculate the interest component is subject to variation When rates change one of the following changes can be done to a loan •The term of the Loan is extended (when rates go up) or contracted (when rates go down) •The Installment (EMI) amount is reset (increased in case rates go up & reduced in case rates come down) •As a practice the term of the home loan is extended since the self-employed customer might have given PDC’s and it would be difficult to replace them on every rate change However in case of under construction properties the Pre-EMI amount is increased by defaultAs a practice Bajaj Finserv does not permit loans which amortize negatively ie where the EMI is insufficient to meet the interest component for a home loan However in case the EMI for a home loan is falling short of the interest component the self-employed customer is informed immediately and offered one of the following remedial options •Change the EMI suitably to match with the balance tenure of a loan •Consider a lump sum part prepayment of principal •A combination of both depending upon customer’s convenience Based on the convenience customers can choose any of the above options The default option is to change the EMI in order to match the balance tenure of a home loanIn case the interest component exceeds 85% of the EMI amount at any time it should be a warning to the customer This will ensure that variation in interest rates does not cause any inconvenienceInternal FRR is the benchmark reference rate This is determined on the basis of market conditions and the cost of funds for the company These changes depend on various external factors and economic conditionsAs per our re-pricing policy home loan interest rates are reviewed every 2 months and a decision is taken whether to change the interest rates or keep that unchangedAs a goodwill gesture and to maintain transparency with our valued existing self-employed customers we ensure through our pro-active downward re-pricing strategy that none of our existing customers are more than 100 bps over and above the last 3 months average sourcing rate If customers are higher than 100 bps from our last 3 months average sourcing rate we carry out downward re-pricing of the rate of interest for them This brings them to maximum 100 bps above the last 3 months average sourcing rate This is a bi-annual exercise This is yet another industry first for any NBFC in the countryHome Loan sanctioned for under construction property is disbursed in installments by us These disbursements in installments are called part / subsequent disbursement You will need to make an online request to Bajaj Finserv for the part disbursementThe time taken by Bajaj Finance depends on the category in which your property falls We categorize every property into APF (Approved Project Facility) and Non APF The time taken by the processing for part disbursement would be 4 working days If the property is part of Approved Project Facility 7 working days If the property is not part of Approved Project FacilityYou will need to

finances The purpose of professional indemnity insurance is to safeguard doctors from professional risks such as legal defense costs claims for compensation injury damage borne by a third party or

invest in a professional indemnity insurance policy Additionally the list of professionals who would benefit from the coverage offered by a professional indemnity insurance policy includes engineers architects counsellors financial consultants chartered accountants contractors and interior decoratorsThe cost of a professional indemnity insurance policy depends on a range of factors To arrive at a figure the insurer could take into account factors such as the sum insured the revenue of the medical practitioner or establishment the professional record of the prospective policyholder as well as the specialty of the medical professional For instance it is believed that as compared to a general physician specialists such as cardiologists or gynecologists are more likely to encounter greater risks at a higher frequency This impacts the premium charged Apart from these factors the size of the establishment equipment skill levels of the support staff such as nurses limits of indemnity selected as well as the ratio of limits are taken into consideration when determining the premium Lastly if you’re renewing your policy remember that the number of claims you have made in the past will have a bearing on the premium The number of claims and the claim amounts help insurers determine what is to be expected and they adjust the premium accordingly However to get a rough estimate you can assume 02% to 1% of the sum insured to be the premium amount that you will have to pay With Bajaj Finserv you can get professional indemnity insurance of up to Rs 1 crore with affordable premiums starting as low as Rs 9440Whether or not professional indemnity insurance is a legal requirement for you depends on the nature of your profession For doctors for instance it isn’t mandatory but is highly recommended The same applies to other service providers such as architects and engineers Given the fact that it provides you with a safety net in the event that you’re caught in a legal liability its benefits far outweigh the associated costPublic liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance may seem similar at first glance but the difference between the two lies in the nuances A public liability insurance policy is a must for a company whose operations can cause property or physical damage to persons A public liability policy also covers the scenario where a third party suffers from physical or property damage owing to being present at the business’ premises On the other hand professional indemnity insurance covers liabilities in a more tailored fashion It covers liabilities strictly arising out of a professional’s services advice or guidance provided to a client or recipient For instance if a patient is suspicious of medical negligence on the part of a doctor he or she may file a legal complaint To address the costs associated with such a complaint the doctor can make use of a professional indemnity insurance policy Disclaimer *Conditions apply This
